Why?
Add more complex mechanics to interplay between players

Hypothesis:
Allowing players to trade will other players for strategic cooperation.

Two use cases:
1. Two players can use the trade mechanic to trade resources the other need allowing both them to grow quicker.

2. Player A and player B are in a fight for WP or just a colour. Player A could help (by giving a good deal) player C to compete with player B on a colour to reduce the WP received by player B or splitting player B focus to handling player C as well as A.


Rules:
Adds trading as action for a cost of 2, which allows the player to trade cards, money, or crew will one willing other player.

Alternative:
Add trade module(s) allow the owner to send trade fleets as action or for free.
