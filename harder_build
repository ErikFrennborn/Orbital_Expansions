Why:
Build space isn't a problem.

Hypothesis:
Reduced the available build slot will make build slots a more value resources. This would make worse cards a bit better and end modules a bit worse.



Rule(s):
Reduce all 3 output modules to 2.

Expect for technical support which now cost 6 to build and is rename to "hub" to better reflect it's usage.
Alt
Reduced all 2 & 3 modules by 1.
